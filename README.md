 The program is built around a RecipeManager class that manages a collection of recipes.

 Recipes are stored in a dictionary, with the recipe name as the key and a dictionary of ingredients and instructions as the value.

 Users can add new recipes by providing a name, a list of ingredients (comma-separated), and cooking instructions.

 The program allows users to view the details of any recipe, showing both the ingredients and the cooking instructions.

Users can search for recipes by entering a keyword, which returns a list of recipes that match the search term in the name.

 Users can update the ingredients or instructions of an existing recipe. If no new values are provided, the existing data remains unchanged.

 Users can delete a recipe by specifying its name, which removes it from the recipe collection.

 The program provides an option to view a list of all recipes stored in the manager.

 A user-friendly menu-driven interface is presented, offering options to add, view, update, delete, search, or view all recipes.

 The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple actions on recipes until they choose to exit the application.
